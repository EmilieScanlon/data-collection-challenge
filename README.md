# data-collection-challenge

This assignment involves scraping data from Mars news websites and analyzing Mars weather data. It is divided into two parts:


Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this part, automated browsing techniques are employed to gather information from Mars news websites. The HTML code is extracted using Splinter and Beautiful Soup. Titles and preview texts of news articles are scraped and stored in a Python list of dictionaries.

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
This section focuses on scraping and analyzing Mars weather data. The HTML table containing weather data is extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Data analysis is conducted to answer specific questions regarding Martian weather patterns. Visualizations are created to aid in understanding the data. Finally, the DataFrame is exported into a CSV file.

Conclusion
This assignment requires a combination of web scraping techniques, data manipulation, and analysis. By completing both parts, you will gain insights into Mars news updates and weather patterns, demonstrating proficiency in data extraction and analysis using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup, Splinter, and Pandas.
